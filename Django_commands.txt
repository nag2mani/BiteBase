   (no need to save)
3. Car.objects.create(**car_dict)

Read:
Car.object.get(id=100)  , if id not present then it will through error.
Car.object.get(id=100)  , if id is not present then it will return empty.

Update method;
x = Car.object.get(id = 1)
x.name = "Creata"
x.speed = 200
x.save()
or
Car.objects.filter(id = 1).update(name = 'dfg')

Delete;
Car.object.get(id = 1).delete()
Car.object.all().delete()   , delete all data of car

Note;
1. If you add __str__ method inside Car class and return self.name then it show name during crud operation.
2. To send data from frontend to backend use POST.
3. To send data from backend to frontend use context which is defined in views.py
